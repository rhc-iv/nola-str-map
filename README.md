### 🛋️ [Homepage](https://github.com/rhc-iv/nola-str-map)

> A project, built in **Python** using `streamlit`, `pandas`, `requests`, and the **New Orleans** public API for its open dataset for short-term rental properties.

## ⚠️ Heads-Up!

As of the most recent changes to the repository, this is a _very_ skeletal app; it lacks much of the functionality that I plan on it having. Whatever files exist in the repo while this message appears are barebones and you will likely see the **Streamlit** framework throw errors!

## Usage

- Open `app.py` in the editor/IDE of your choice.
- Run the application by typing in your terminal: `streamlit run app.py`
